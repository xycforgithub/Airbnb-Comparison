I like finding my own way around your city or neighborhood and am not often inside the place I am sleeping, except for to sleep and shower.\n\nAs a host, since I love new people, I am happy to be as involved or not involved in your stay in Seattle as you would like.

Also, with the love of baking/cooking, comes access to whatever is in my fridge or pantry at the time. Often this means homemade jams or peanut butter, something sweet, maybe leftovers from a meal, or the ready to go smoothie packs or breakfast sandwiches that I freeze and then grab as needed.

The heated floors keep the place at the perfect temp day or night. Lots of natural light fills the space from the 5 clerestory windows. The kitchen is fully equipped with a 2 burner stove, mini fridge and freezer and everything you need to cook and eat in. The bathroom has a shower and state of the art composting toilet that separates liquids from solids and vents out all odor.

I believe in treating people with the utmost care and respect. When you stay at my home, I want you to feel like it's your home. Kick back and relax. If you need a pointer or 2, feel free to ask. I speak French, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish and am learning Arabic right now. I grew up in a French province and used to bartend so I can probably pick you out a drink if you're in need of libation. I'm also a foodie that both eats out a lot as well as cooks; I can certainly appreciate a judiciously prepared bite and LOVE LOVE LOVE to help people find a satisfying meal. Random jobs I've held the past of note: stunt woman, bouncer, door-to-door sales, microbiologist, human/bovine tissue engineer. Right now, I'm a software architect. My husband also works in software and we have a 1 year daughter who loves to wriggle and play. He speaks Arabic, French and German. She speaks to turtles, pandas and coffee mugs.\n\nAs a guest: I've traveled to 3 continents and 9 countries so far. I like to pack as light as possible (backpack preferred). I'm not afraid to drive stick (even when it's been a decade since I've last tried). Ordering off menu is always a fun adventure. I also try to avoid tourist areas and go after secretly coveted local places that only natives enjoy. I've never joined a curated tour group and I hope I never do. I've pet tigers in Chiang Mai, bathed with Yakuza in Tokyo, eaten scorpions in Beijing, shot snake vodka in Taipei, swam with jellyfish in Valencia, was marooned in both Paris and Madrid, witnessed the entire starry universe in a town just outside of Stuttgart... the list just goes on. My next trip is to the French/Italian Riviera for some serious R&R.\n\nMy motto: You only live once.

And I live by that. \n\nIn 2014 I finally became a fully-fledged yoga teacher in the Anusara tradition. Although I practice regularly, I have not yet found a space (more a mental space than an actual studio) to teach. But I patiently wait. It will happen once it's time. In the meantime, I enjoy exploring different studios and traditions. Seattle has so much to offer when it comes to yoga.

One of my biggest pleasures in life is learning about a new place, new people, new food- both through my own travels and as a host.  My friends would describe me as active, open, engaging, funny and liberal. I was raised in the deep South of the USA (Georgia), the youngest of 5 siblings, but have lived in Seattle for 25+ years. Seattle is a hot bed of music talent, and I take advantage of it by staying updated on emerging talent and attending as many live performances as I can. I am often the oldest person there, but so what! You could not ask for a better city to live in if you are a foodie, as I am.  The variety here is unbelievable. My profession is Interior Design, so of course, design and art are an important part of my life. Books, and more books- don't even try to talk to me if I have a book in my hand!\n\nI have three absolutely gorgeous and brilliant daughters who no longer live with me, which naturally makes them even more attractive! They live in Los Angeles and San Francisco and I visit them often.\n\nMy travels have included, but are not restricted to: most of the states within the USA, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Argentina, Cuba, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Morocco, South Africa, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and China. I love hiking, camping, and staying places off the beaten tourist path. I will always choose a host over a hotel- how better to really learn something about the place you bothered to travel?\n\nOnce upon a time, I spoke pretty decent Italian, but am rusty and out of practice. I would love some Italian guests to practice with (or rather, \"with whom to practice\", as I will claim to be a grammar expert). My French is even rustier. I have begun to study Spanish recently. I have a great love of the English language and grammar- yes, I was that person in school who loved diagramming sentences, and always had my hand in the air to answer the grammar questions while everyone else's eyes were rolling back in their heads!

I made it as comfortable as possible for you, but it is hard to combat age and for lack of a better word,  basementness. If you are short, on a budget, or used to the youth hostel lifestyle, this may be the place for you. \n\nI am a professor at the UW, here in Seattle.  In the winter I am a pretty serious about hitting the mountains for skiing and snowboarding.  \n\nWhen I was eleven years old, I saw Star Wars Episode 4, and I haven't been able to concentrate since then. Even though I am solidly into middle age, I love living in my super hip Seattle neighborhood, and I still go see live music a couple times a month.  \n\nIn my twenties and thirties, I would backpack through Europe once or twice a year.  One of the greatest things I ever did was decide to rent an apartment in Prague for a week instead of staying in a hotel or hostel.  I decided to create this little, private, room in my house so that young travelers ( maybe you?) can visit Seattle on a budget. \n\nI have traveled all over the world, maybe I have visited your town? \n\nWhat type of place is this?\n\nAre you looking for an expensive, warm, plush, modern room with great light and tall ceilings?  If so, you should probably move on.  This is a tiny, private room with a private entrance and private bathroom in my basement.  Basements have LOW ceilings, about 6 foot 2 inches, with a low beam that folks taller than 5 foot 9 will need to duck under.  In the winter, basements tend to be cold and damp, there is no way to avoid this. I will provide you with a radiant heater so that you can keep it warm if the ambient heat isn't enough for you.   It has a full size fridge, a coffee pot, a TV, wired and wireless internet, a small bed, a desk, a microwave, a coffee maker, a teapot, a pizza oven.... If you are short, ( ceiling is only 6' tall) if you are a traveler on a budget, if you are used to staying in 2 star European hostels and hotels, and sharing a bath with 20 other people, this place will be perfect for you. \n\nBasically, this is a Hobbit hole, if you are looking for someplace super nice, move on.  If you are looking for something affordable in an AMAZING NEIGHBORHOOD this may work for you.  \n\nYou can walk downtown in 35 mins, 10 mins to Broadway, and 3 mins to grocery stores, bars, and amazing restaurants...\n\nWhat type of host am I?\n\nYou may never even see me.  Once we make arrangements, I will give you the map, the code to the electronic lock, and you can come and go as you please.  \n", "host_response_time": "within an hour", "host_response_rate": "90%", "host_acceptance_rate": "100%", "host_is_superhost": "f", "host_thumbnail_url": "https://a1.muscache.com/ac/users/42940083/profile_pic/1440978362/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=50:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70", "host_picture_url": "https://a1.muscache.com/ac/users/42940083/profile_pic/1440978362/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=225:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70", "host_neighbourhood": "Stevens", "host_listings_count": "1", "host_total_listings_count": "1", "host_verifications": "['email', 'phone', 'linkedin', 'reviews', 'kba']", "host_has_profile_pic": "t", "host_identity_verified": "t", "street": "18th Avenue East, Seattle, WA 98112, United States", "neighbourhood": "Stevens", "neighbourhood_cleansed": "Stevens", "neighbourhood_group_cleansed": "Capitol Hill", "city": "Seattle", "state": "WA", "zipcode": "98112", "market": "Seattle", "smart_location": "Seattle, WA", "country_code": "US", "country": "United States", "latitude": "47.62005089148471", "longitude": "-122.3093351235339", "is_location_exact": "t", "property_type": "Apartment", "room_type": "Entire home/apt", "accommodates": "2", "bathrooms": "1.0", "bedrooms": "1", "beds": "1", "bed_type": "Real Bed", "amenities": "{\"Cable TV\",Internet,\"Wireless Internet\",Kitchen,\"Pets live on this property\",Cat(s),\"Smoke Detector\",Essentials}", "square_feet": "", "price": "$45.00", "weekly_price": "$300.00", "monthly_price": "$1,150.00", "security_deposit": "$200.00", "cleaning_fee": "$52.00", "guests_included": "1", "extra_people": "$7.00", "minimum_nights": "2", "maximum_nights": "30", "calendar_updated": "5 days ago", "has_availability": "t", "availability_30": "19", "availability_60": "42", "availability_90": "67", "availability_365": "156", "calendar_last_scraped": "2016-01-04", "number_of_reviews": "8", "first_review": "2015-10-03", "last_review": "2015-12-31", "review_scores_rating": "97", "review_scores_accuracy": "10", "review_scores_cleanliness": "9", "review_scores_checkin": "10", "review_scores_communication": "10", "review_scores_location": "10", "review_scores_value": "10", "requires_license": "f", "license": "", "jurisdiction_names": "WASHINGTON", "instant_bookable": "t", "cancellation_policy": "moderate", "require_guest_profile_picture": "f", "require_guest_phone_verification": "f", "calculated_host_listings_count": "1", "reviews_per_month": "2.55"}, {"id": "3630581", "listing_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3630581", "scrape_id": "20160104002432", "last_scraped": "2016-01-04", "name": "Center UW Comfy Quiet & View (302)", "summary": "It has a Walk Score of 98 out of 100.

I'll be your go-to gal for all questions on bookings. \n\nMark Chambers and Oda Egeland have owned St. John's since January 2005.  When they bought it they were enchanted by the bones of the building.  Built in 1905, it has an old charm missing in newer buildings.  They went to work on it, remodeling every apartment, putting in new plumbing and electrical, and making it modern in almost all conveniences (no dishwashers or elevator.)  Mark did most of the work himself.  We now have several short term apartments and 17 long term apartments.  It's a great building.  They live in the country, 30 miles from St. John's, and when one of their short terms is open they stay in them. I'm sure you'll love it too!\n\nA little bit about me: Mark and Oda hired me to manage their short term rental units, and help out as their personal assistant for whatever else! I help them throw big parties in their country home, do renovations on their barn, and entertain them with terrible jokes. I'm a big art nerd and have converted the basement of St. John's into my studio space. I love to travel - but hate feeling touristy, so I love AirBnB's people-to-people way of seeing the world. My style of hosting is mostly just let you do your thing, but I love when people drop in my office for a chat and I'm always happy to dole out some advice on Seattle! I was born and raised in this city so I know it pretty well by now, despite a decade of living elsewhere in my short life. I wrote the neighborhood guide in the guest handbook in each unit, so you can also read about some of my favorite spots in there! \n\nI've been pondering this nugget lately: \"trade your cleverness in for awe.\" Helps to look up at the sky; there's always something awe-inspiring going on up there.", "host_response_time": "within a day", "host_response_rate": "93%", "host_acceptance_rate": "100%", "host_is_superhost": "f", "host_thumbnail_url": "https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/1787819/profile_pic/1401299439/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=50:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70", "host_picture_url": "https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/1787819/profile_pic/1401299439/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=225:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70", "host_neighbourhood": "First Hill", "host_listings_count": "8", "host_total_listings_count": "8", "host_verifications": "['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba']", "host_has_profile_pic": "t", "host_identity_verified": "t", "street": "East Pike Street, Seattle, WA 98122, United States", "neighbourhood": "First Hill", "neighbourhood_cleansed": "Broadway", "neighbourhood_group_cleansed": "Capitol Hill", "city": "Seattle", "state": "WA", "zipcode": "98122", "market": "Seattle", "smart_location": "Seattle, WA", "country_code": "US", "country": "United States", "latitude": "47.61484239747943", "longitude": "-122.32356914291927", "is_location_exact": "t", "property_type": "Apartment", "room_type": "Entire home/apt", "accommodates": "6", "bathrooms": "1.0", "bedrooms": "2", "beds": "3", "bed_type": "Real Bed", "amenities": "{TV,\"Cable TV\",Internet,\"Wireless Internet\",\"Air Conditioning\",Kitchen,\"Buzzer/Wireless Intercom\",Heating,\"Family/Kid Friendly\",Washer,Dryer,\"Smoke Detector\",\"Carbon Monoxide Detector\",\"First Aid Kit\",\"Fire Extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo}", "square_feet": "", "price": "$204.00", "weekly_price": "$1,148.00", "monthly_price": "$4,020.00", "security_deposit": "", "cleaning_fee": "$60.00", "guests_included": "1", "extra_people": "$0.00", "minimum_nights": "3", "maximum_nights": "90", "calendar_updated": "4 days ago", "has_availability": "t", "availability_30": "27", "availability_60": "57", "availability_90": "80", "availability_365": "327", "calendar_last_scraped": "2016-01-04", "number_of_reviews": "31", "first_review": "2013-06-07", "last_review": "2015-12-01", "review_scores_rating": "92", "review_scores_accuracy": "10", "review_scores_cleanliness": "10", "review_scores_checkin": "10", "review_scores_communication": "10", "review_scores_location": "9", "review_scores_value": "9", "requires_license": "f", "license": "", "jurisdiction_names": "WASHINGTON", "instant_bookable": "f", "cancellation_policy": "strict", "require_guest_profile_picture": "f", "require_guest_phone_verification": "f", "calculated_host_listings_count": "6", "reviews_per_month": "0.99"}, {"id": "4395654", "listing_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4395654", "scrape_id": "20160104002432", "last_scraped": "2016-01-04", "name": "West Seattle Suite Shagalicious", "summary": "A Seattle Times Pacific NW Magazine showcase!  800 sf open-concept studio for 3, King-size memory-foam bed, high-end sleeper, Sound & mountain views, Fireplace, Private outdoor areas, 10 min. to Downtown, Alki Beach, Walk to bus and Morgan Junction.", "space": "Live for a time like you're on the set of Madmen in 800 square feet of authentic, midcentury modern style, all part of a 1958 custom-built home by Swedish-born designer, Martin Ollas.

I will never stay in a hotel again, if I can help it. Living where the locals live and to interact with them is a huge part of the experience.  \n\nI was born in Germany and came to California when I was very young.  You might say that I came on a whim, with hardly an idea what I was getting into.  But it all worked out beautifully.   \nRenting to vacationers has always been a dream, one might say, it has been on the \"bucket list.\"  I rent out a room in my own house and have met so many wonderful people, mostly from countries other than the USA.\n\nMy Airbnb in Seatle is a sort of branching out.  It will be a place for us to stay when we will visit our daughter, who moved here after college.

For tourist activities, the Seattle Trolley stops next to the building, and the duck tour is only 3 blocks away. The Seattle Art Museum is a block away. The new Seattle Great Wheel is less than a 10 minute walk. And of course Pike Place Market is a must-see.

For overnight parking, there are a limited number of guest spots available in our garage for $10/night. Please see the Newmark concierge for additional information and to request guest parking. Please note that guest parking is not available from 8am-8pm due to Target's policy. For other parking options please visit seattle DOT bestparking . C0M for up-to-date pricing on parking downtown.

I'll be your go-to gal for all questions on bookings. \n\nMark Chambers and Oda Egeland have owned St. John's since January 2005.  When they bought it they were enchanted by the bones of the building.  Built in 1905, it has an old charm missing in newer buildings.  They went to work on it, remodeling every apartment, putting in new plumbing and electrical, and making it modern in almost all conveniences (no dishwashers or elevator.)  Mark did most of the work himself.  We now have several short term apartments and 17 long term apartments.  It's a great building.  They live in the country, 30 miles from St. John's, and when one of their short terms is open they stay in them. I'm sure you'll love it too!\n\nA little bit about me: Mark and Oda hired me to manage their short term rental units, and help out as their personal assistant for whatever else! I help them throw big parties in their country home, do renovations on their barn, and entertain them with terrible jokes. I'm a big art nerd and have converted the basement of St. John's into my studio space. I love to travel - but hate feeling touristy, so I love AirBnB's people-to-people way of seeing the world. My style of hosting is mostly just let you do your thing, but I love when people drop in my office for a chat and I'm always happy to dole out some advice on Seattle! I was born and raised in this city so I know it pretty well by now, despite a decade of living elsewhere in my short life.

Thank you for reading my profile on airbnb. My name is Kathy and I have lived in Seattle for over twenty five years.

It was an obvious choice because we travel a lot and we enjoy meeting people from all over the world.  We are new to the AirBnb community.  We have a legal unit with all the permits so instead of just renting the space out, we decided that it would be more fun and exciting be hosts for the new sharing economy.  \nAs an airbnb host, my number one priority is to make you feel completely at home.  I will be available as much as you want or I will stay out of your way.  The downstairs is completely separate.  You will have your privacy.  Our house is in the Laurelhurst part of Seattle.  It is fitted with everything you could possibly need to have a cozy and warm time, including a gas fireplace with a remote, full bath with heated floors.  The wifi works great.\nWe have so many glorious memories in this house, we will do whatever we can to make your stay in Seattle great.\nMy favorite quote is from Helen Keller, \"Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all\",  being a host for AirBnb has been a daring adventure and it has given energy to our empty nest.", "host_response_time": "within an hour", "host_response_rate": "100%", "host_acceptance_rate": "100%", "host_is_superhost": "f", "host_thumbnail_url": "https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/16206353/profile_pic/1410373550/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=50:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70", "host_picture_url": "https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/16206353/profile_pic/1410373550/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=225:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70", "host_neighbourhood": "Laurelhurst", "host_listings_count": "1", "host_total_listings_count": "1", "host_verifications": "['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio']", "host_has_profile_pic": "t", "host_identity_verified": "t", "street": "Northeast 43rd Street, Seattle, WA 98105, United States", "neighbourhood": "Laurelhurst", "neighbourhood_cleansed": "Laurelhurst", "neighbourhood_group_cleansed": "Other neighborhoods", "city": "Seattle", "state": "WA", "zipcode": "98105", "market": "Seattle", "smart_location": "Seattle, WA", "country_code": "US", "country": "United States", "latitude": "47.6596404841275", "longitude": "-122.27077772581688", "is_location_exact": "t", "property_type": "Apartment", "room_type": "Entire home/apt", "accommodates": "4", "bathrooms": "1.0", "bedrooms": "2", "beds": "4", "bed_type": "Real Bed", "amenities": "{TV,\"Cable TV\",Internet,\"Wireless Internet\",\"Air Conditioning\",Kitchen,\"Free Parking on Premises\",\"Pets Allowed\",Gym,\"Pets live on this property\",Dog(s),\"Indoor Fireplace\",Heating,\"Family/Kid Friendly\",Washer,Dryer,\"Smoke Detector\",\"Carbon Monoxide Detector\",\"First Aid Kit\",\"Safety Card\",\"Fire Extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,\"Hair Dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop Friendly Workspace\"}", "square_feet": "", "price": "$185.00", "weekly_price": "$1,100.00", "monthly_price": "$3,100.00", "security_deposit": "$100.00", "cleaning_fee": "$100.00", "guests_included": "4", "extra_people": "$20.00", "minimum_nights": "3", "maximum_nights": "30", "calendar_updated": "today", "has_availability": "t", "availability_30": "0", "availability_60": "28", "availability_90": "58", "availability_365": "146", "calendar_last_scraped": "2016-01-04", "number_of_reviews": "15", "first_review": "2014-09-23", "last_review": "2015-12-26", "review_scores_rating": "99", "review_scores_accuracy": "10", "review_scores_cleanliness": "10", "review_scores_checkin": "10", "review_scores_communication": "10", "review_scores_location": "10", "review_scores_value": "10", "requires_license": "f", "license": "", "jurisdiction_names": "WASHINGTON", "instant_bookable": "t", "cancellation_policy": "moderate", "require_guest_profile_picture": "f", "require_guest_phone_verification": "f", "calculated_host_listings_count": "1", "reviews_per_month": "0.96"}, {"id": "2858482", "listing_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2858482", "scrape_id": "20160104002432", "last_scraped": "2016-01-04", "name": "Quiet, sunny Phinney 1BR oasis", "summary": "Enjoy the largest bedroom in our charming 1900's spacious 3 Bedroom / 1 bath home on Phinney Ridge close to many of Seattle's most hip, fun and family friendly destinations.

We have been airbnb hosts for a year and have just been named Superhosts by airbnb. We have a beautiful home, offer great service and are excited to offer our beautiful home to you.\n\nWe have lived in Seattle for many years. We both came to Seattle in 1979; Charlie from Brooklyn by way of NJ and Sarah from Texas by way of the world. We met in 1983 and were married on 8-8-88.\n\nCharlie has a background in environmental affairs, non-profit leadership and government service. He is also an accomplished amateur photographer. Sarah has a background in art, is a Real Estate agent and manages our properties. \n\nOur interests are art, music, dance, cooking, gardening and caring for our 3 god-children. \n\nWe bought this house in 2001 and lived in it for 12 years.  We have recently bought a house in the Columbia City neighborhood of Seattle to be closer to our god-children - which made this home available for airbnb. \n\nWe travel often to Mexico, Texas, around the Pacific NW and to the NJ-NY area.  We just celebrated our 25th Anniversary by spending a month in Paris.  While there, we stayed in 4 different apartments and got a real idea of what to do - and what not to do - in order to be the perfect airbnb host.

We love travel guide books, and do a lot of research into where to stay, what to do, and where to eat, but airbnb helps you feel like a local and find places that you're less likely to find online or in a book. Which is super helpful for us since we're total foodies.\n\nWe started hosting guests in the summer of 2015. We have a cute spare room that we've put a lot of energy into.

I know the area very well and can offer great insights if you let me know a bit about what your plans are and what you would like to do and explore. As for me, recently I have been spending a lot of time on my new boat and doing restoration work. I'm around and responsive to general questions or recommendations. \n\nMy dog:\nI have a female dog named Lucky who is about 8 years old now and comes with me sometimes. She still acts like a puppy and has a bad habit of jumping up on people that I don't think I will ever train her out of. Lucky is harmless and has never bitten anyone but she can become territorial at times. \n\nA little more about my background if your curious:\nI am a former pro athlete who has worked as a personal trainer and group exercise instructor. I transitioned from one on one training to group exercise sessions leading hour long classes aimed at high intensity cardio, targeted strength building movement patterns and stretching.

(UberX and Lyft require a smartphone and a credit card).  I don't mind giving people rides for a fee that undercuts these services when I have the time (just ask), but I don't drive at night or more than 10 miles away.  New users in town of Lyft or UberX often get a travel credit. Use RelayRides to rent a locals' car, or use Zipcar or car2go to drive yourself around.

I lived on Capitol Hill in a condo until moving to this house on North Beacon Hill in 2002.  This neighborhood is RELATIVELY close to downtown (but not IN downtown) and convenient for AirBnB guests with vehicle who are looking for a compromise between hostel and motel or else don't mind riding public transit or using UberX and Lyft to visit all the major tourist sights.\n\nI spend most of my time reading or on my computer in my office. I am a self-employed property manager who lives/works from home so talking to guests who visit is a refreshing break from a mostly solitary life.  I have a degree in English literature and traveled widely before settling down and \"getting married\" to my house.  I am happy to rent extra space in my home out as long as you are a clean, quiet, self-sufficient and low-maintenance guest.  Please note AirBnB does not do criminal background checks so when I get a request I WILL look your name up on the internet to see if you appear to have a \"safe\" profile.  Please make sure your booking request includes the information I request for best results. I started hosting people in July 2014.  As a host I need guests to make sure they understand what they are getting. I don't want a guest who doesn't bother to read my listing, then gives me less than 5 stars for things they should've expected before arriving (such as LOCATION - how does a host fix their Location? It's on the map!) or Value (did you not search other listings first? If you want Value join the homeless and go pitch a tent downtown! They have a better location, no house rules, and don't have to recycle!) If you don't understand the cost of owning real estate  in Seattle with its property taxes, sales taxes, cost of utilities and insurance rates, then don't review me on your assumptions of what you think the room price should be here without doing some comparison shopping first. We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto!  Bottom line: I offer cheap room rentals for short-stay travelers as long as they are well-behaved guests. If you are looking for hotel quality accommodations at this price on Airbnb - you're just NOT going to find it unless you pay hotel quality prices or stay in a place much further out from downtown.\n\nIf you are new to AirBnB please look up the internet article:\nRead These Tips, or Nobody Will Ever Let You Be an Airbnb Guest Again.  \n\nIf you are considering becoming a host yourself, I recommend looking up AirBnB Horror Stories and AirbnB Rental Nightmares to understand the risk and liability involved in being one.\n\nSee listings available in my 4 bedroom, 1.75 bathroom house:\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4374326\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3953365\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3977450\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3646357\n\nRoom rates may change on a daily basis based on market supply and demand and are not locked in until a booking confirmation is made.

The Fremont Arts Council and the Fremont Abbey for arts and performance oriented  creativity and activities, the Chamber for growing and sustaining businesses, and the local color everywhere.   Walking along the Burke Gilman Trail at the base of Phinney Avenue by the life sized dinosaur topiaries is a great way to spend time and get a ground level view of the canal and all the boats and ships that pass by.  Stopping at the Lighthouse Roaster for incredibly delicious coffee and a variety of teas gives you a taste of a local and very popular neighborhood meeting place. Following the many connecting stairways and paths in the area gives you a very special experience of this great neighborhood.  There is a newly finished neighborhood stair case on Greenwood Avenue.

But there's always a lot to do in Seattle.  Be sure to check out hiking sites ((URL HIDDEN) and tour info on line.  At the house there will be information too.  Fremont itself is fun year round and there's a lot to do.  Check out the info guide on this site.  Don't forget the troll, and the huge planet on top of the Saturn Building at 35th And Evanston Ave.  If you are a jogger and train, the steps between Greenwood Ave and 2nd Ave are a good choice when picking a trail around the neighborhood. The markets on Sundays in Fremont and Ballard  are great.  In Fremont there are often Food Trucks and a pizza oven to tempt you as well as lots of cool finds from the region and around the world.  Always ask if you don't find what you want. WINTER SKIING:  Snoqualmie Pass is 45 minutes away and has really popular night skiing.  Alpental offers more challenging runs.

There are quite a few bus schedules available so if just ask if you don't see one in your room. A convenient way from the airport is to take the Light Rail train to the University Street station and walk one block north and one block east (up hill) to 3rd and Union where you can catch the 5 bus.  Get out at 43rd and Phinney Avenue by the Lighthouse Roaster.  Then maybe grab a great cup of coffee and call Uber for your quick ride down the hill to the house.   Fremont has a high walk score and the neighborhood has a couple of amazing hills for a good workout. By car you are an hour to Snoqualmie Pass; two hours to Mt Rainier; 20 minutes to the Seattle Public Market (Pike Place Market) which is a favorite; under 3 hours to Portland, 2.5 hours or so to Vancouver BC depending on the border delays, 1 hour over the Narrows (double) Bridge to Gig Harbor, ", "thumbnail_url": "https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/17248806/5a4b62eb_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=small&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70", "medium_url": "https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/17248806/5a4b62eb_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium", "picture_url": "https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/17248806/5a4b62eb_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70", "xl_picture_url": "https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/17248806/5a4b62eb_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=x_large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70", "host_id": "3921530", "host_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3921530", "host_name": "Ann Petrich", "host_since": "2012-10-19", "host_location": "Seattle, Washington, United States", "host_about": " I love art and \"creation.\" I love to travel.  I look forward to winter snowshoeing, some US travel, hosting on airbnb and a trip to France.  2016 will be my 4th year as an airbnb host.   I speak French and Spanish (much better French) and I have worked in education, real estate, video, and parade art ensemble builds. \n\nMy home is in the \"center of the Universe\" in the artsy and eclectic Fremont area - where you find the Troll under Aurora bridge, a great PCC coop, banks, shops, cafes, and a great night life as well.  \n\n2016 Holiday Season\nHoliday events in and around Fremont include the lighting of the Lenin Statue (for real), a parade of caroling boats creating truly heavenly sounds, the Fremont Arts Council Winter Feast on or close to Dec 21, great shopping for unique gifts at all the local shops, First Friday art walk, New Years Eve spectacular fire works on Lake Union, and access to all the Seattle 2016 holiday excitement including the Nutcracker with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, and Seattle Symphony's New Years Eve Party!  \n\nSummer Solstice\nThe famous Fremont Solstice Parade happens every June close to summer solstice.  In 2014 I was an Ice Queen Clown and accompanied a 7 foot articulated wolf/dog made from reed and white papier machee created by local artist, Sarah Lovett. In 2015 I was a banner carrier with the lead Samba ensemble group Girasol.  \n\nThe Neighborhood\nAs to the Fremont neighborhood, I moved here years ago thinking I'd stay a couple of years but many lattes, parades  and  3 homes later, I'm still here.  We have a smaller community of artsy, smart and creative people with heart, in the middle of the big city.  I live on a hill and have a partial view of Mt Rainier on a sunny / clear day from one of the rooms and the back deck.  And it's always great to come home to this charming and awesome neighborhood.\n\nFOODIE w/o gluten!!\nAfter years, and maybe more years, I'm pretty much gluten and heavy carb free.  My cooking includes salads, chicken, veggies both raw and cooked, broths and soups, coffee, tea, coconut and chocolate desserts.  Love coconut oil and fresh salmon.\nBut I taste just about everything and never turn my nose up my guests regional cooking shares.\n\nMORE...\nFor myself living without the open road, great friends, dream time, and my favorite shoes including some well seasoned ostrich boots from the Boot Lady in Seattle, is not an option.  \n\nAND this year 2016, the cute and lovable 1 bedroom apartment is available for you too.  With a full kitchen and bath, and a great 40\" Vizio flat screen that works with your chrome cast service,  you will love it. If you want extra privacy, your own fridge and cooking space,  and/or room for a couple of friends to travel with you, pick this option.  If you want 100% remodeled please continue your search.  If you love the unique and artistic life, clean, well supplied and situated on a country lane in the city do check out \"Super cool in artsy Fremont\"!     \n\nFavorite coffee - Lighthouse Roaster from right up the street at 43rd and Phinney.\nFavorite view - from the sun dial at the top of Gas Works Park hill.\nFavorite Seattle park - Discovery Park\nWhat I think about Eastern WA - it's an excellent secret - with wide open valleys, rolling hills, rivers, wheat fields and when the rain is over the top in Seattle, there's nearly always SUN!\n\nHow I feel about Puget Sound - big love - have to hop a ferry at least a few times a year to visit an Island or the Olympic Penninsula; have to walk on a gravel beach and skip a few rocks to remember the incomparable beauty of the place; seagulls make me (website hidden). Rainier is my sacred mountain - it calls me each year at least once to hike or snowshoe and feel the awesome presence of its magnetic core.  \n\nI love traveling in France and Europe in general, Mexico, the American West and Southwest, and now, South America.  My favorite way to travel is to friends or family who live there.  Or with a group of like minded people on a small group tour.  Or by car locally and in the Southwest where the wide open spaces bring freedom to my soul.", "host_response_time": "within a few hours", "host_response_rate": "100%", "host_acceptance_rate": "100%", "host_is_superhost": "f", "host_thumbnail_url": "https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/3921530/profile_pic/1413047905/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=50:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70", "host_picture_url": "https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/3921530/profile_pic/1413047905/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=225:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70", "host_neighbourhood": "Fremont", "host_listings_count": "3", "host_total_listings_count": "3", "host_verifications": "['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'google', 'reviews', 'kba']", "host_has_profile_pic": "t", "host_identity_verified": "t", "street": "North 40th Street, Seattle, WA 98103, United States", "neighbourhood": "Fremont", "neighbourhood_cleansed": "Fremont", "neighbourhood_group_cleansed": "Other neighborhoods", "city": "Seattle", "state": "WA", "zipcode": "98103", "market": "Seattle", "smart_location": "Seattle, WA", "country_code": "US", "country": "United States", "latitude": "47.6548713025183", "longitude": "-122.35325551487102", "is_location_exact": "t", "property_type": "House", "room_type": "Private room", "accommodates": "3", "bathrooms": "1.0", "bedrooms": "1", "beds": "2", "bed_type": "Real Bed", "amenities": "{Internet,\"Wireless Internet\",Kitchen,\"Free Parking on Premises\",Breakfast,\"Indoor Fireplace\",Heating,\"Family/Kid Friendly\",Washer,Dryer,\"Smoke Detector\",\"Carbon Monoxide Detector\",\"First Aid Kit\",\"Fire Extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,\"Hair Dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop Friendly Workspace\"}", "square_feet": "", "price": "$50.00", "weekly_price": "$340.00", "monthly_price": "$1,200.00", "security_deposit": "$100.00", "cleaning_fee": "$35.00", "guests_included": "2", "extra_people": "$15.00", "minimum_nights": "3", "maximum_nights": "16", "calendar_updated": "2 days ago", "has_availability": "t", "availability_30": "17", "availability_60": "41", "availability_90": "70", "availability_365": "70", "calendar_last_scraped": "2016-01-04", "number_of_reviews": "58", "first_review": "2013-06-08", "last_review": "2015-12-23", "review_scores_rating": "94", "review_scores_accuracy": "9", "review_scores_cleanliness": "9", "review_scores_checkin": "10", "review_scores_communication": "10", "review_scores_location": "10", "review_scores_value": "10", "requires_license": "f", "license": "", "jurisdiction_names": "WASHINGTON", "instant_bookable": "f", "cancellation_policy": "moderate", "require_guest_profile_picture": "f", "require_guest_phone_verification": "t", "calculated_host_listings_count": "3", "reviews_per_month": "1.85"}, {"id": "4384800", "listing_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4384800", "scrape_id": "20160104002432", "last_scraped": "2016-01-04", "name": "North Admiral Penthouse-W.Seattle", "summary": "Private Penthouse View Suite-close To Airport, City, Alki Beach, all amenities including walking distance to shopping, historic movie theater, restaurants, coffee shops and bars.", "space": "North Admiral two bedroom penthouse apartment with great city view and 700 sq foot roof top deck.

The character of the neighbourhood has always been a bit rough and tumble, influenced heavily by the Scandinavians and others who came here to build, repair and work the boats that catch most of the US's salmon. A couple of decades ago Ballard was heavily blue collar. Wearing the wrong rubber boots into a bar could get you beat up and the town smelled like hard liquor, sweat and fish. But things change, and the gentrification that's morphed other formerly blue collar neighbourhoods, like Brooklyn, NY, has landed here in Ballard, too. Great cafes, restaurants (some of the best new places to eat in the US), shops, coffee roasters and beer makers have all been popping up and helping define the new Old Ballard as smart, hip, well-heeled and discriminating.

I also lived in Washington DC for around 4 years.  This means that I'm an avid Cubs and Bears fan, but love the Washington Capitols, and am becoming a big Seattle Sounders fan as well.  \n\nSo, with being from the Midwest, trekking to the East coast, and now living on the far west coast, I have friends and family all across the country.  I travel to see the people whom I miss and care about deeply, as well as continue to see cities and areas in the US, and all over the world as well.\n\nHow do I travel and see an area?  Through food and conversation!  I love to experience a new area through the eyes and tastes of those who live in a city. I ask the locals where to get coffee and if they had only one last place to eat at in the city, where they would go.  I adore farmers markets and local shows and (website hidden), good wine, lots of sunlight, and hitting the road with my running shoes are all things I love in life.  I'm looking forward to using Airbnb on many of my future trips.  I've stayed in hotels and many bed and breakfasts on my travels.  But, sometimes I like to hit that farmers market, grab great food and whip up a great meal with wine I've snagged along the way.

I look forward to winter snowshoeing, some US travel, hosting on airbnb and a trip to France.  2016 will be my 4th year as an airbnb host.   I speak French and Spanish (much better French) and I have worked in education, real estate, video, and parade art ensemble builds. \n\nMy home is in the \"center of the Universe\" in the artsy and eclectic Fremont area - where you find the Troll under Aurora bridge, a great PCC coop, banks, shops, cafes, and a great night life as well.  \n\n2016 Holiday Season\nHoliday events in and around Fremont include the lighting of the Lenin Statue (for real), a parade of caroling boats creating truly heavenly sounds, the Fremont Arts Council Winter Feast on or close to Dec 21, great shopping for unique gifts at all the local shops, First Friday art walk, New Years Eve spectacular fire works on Lake Union, and access to all the Seattle 2016 holiday excitement including the Nutcracker with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, and Seattle Symphony's New Years Eve Party!  \n\nSummer Solstice\nThe famous Fremont Solstice Parade happens every June close to summer solstice.  In 2014 I was an Ice Queen Clown and accompanied a 7 foot articulated wolf/dog made from reed and white papier machee created by local artist, Sarah Lovett. In 2015 I was a banner carrier with the lead Samba ensemble group Girasol.  \n\nThe Neighborhood\nAs to the Fremont neighborhood, I moved here years ago thinking I'd stay a couple of years but many lattes, parades  and  3 homes later, I'm still here.  We have a smaller community of artsy, smart and creative people with heart, in the middle of the big city.  I live on a hill and have a partial view of Mt Rainier on a sunny / clear day from one of the rooms and the back deck.  And it's always great to come home to this charming and awesome neighborhood.\n\nFOODIE w/o gluten!!\nAfter years, and maybe more years, I'm pretty much gluten and heavy carb free.  My cooking includes salads, chicken, veggies both raw and cooked, broths and soups, coffee, tea, coconut and chocolate desserts.  Love coconut oil and fresh salmon.\nBut I taste just about everything and never turn my nose up my guests regional cooking shares.\n\nMORE...\nFor myself living without the open road, great friends, dream time, and my favorite shoes including some well seasoned ostrich boots from the Boot Lady in Seattle, is not an option.  \n\nAND this year 2016, the cute and lovable 1 bedroom apartment is available for you too.  With a full kitchen and bath, and a great 40\" Vizio flat screen that works with your chrome cast service,  you will love it. If you want extra privacy, your own fridge and cooking space,  and/or room for a couple of friends to travel with you, pick this option.  If you want 100% remodeled please continue your search.  If you love the unique and artistic life, clean, well supplied and situated on a country lane in the city do check out \"Super cool in artsy Fremont\"!     \n\nFavorite coffee - Lighthouse Roaster from right up the street at 43rd and Phinney.\nFavorite view - from the sun dial at the top of Gas Works Park hill.\nFavorite Seattle park - Discovery Park\nWhat I think about Eastern WA - it's an excellent secret - with wide open valleys, rolling hills, rivers, wheat fields and when the rain is over the top in Seattle, there's nearly always SUN!\n\nHow I feel about Puget Sound - big love - have to hop a ferry at least a few times a year to visit an Island or the Olympic Penninsula; have to walk on a gravel beach and skip a few rocks to remember the incomparable beauty of the place; seagulls make me (website hidden).

I'll make myself sound extremely fun to be around.\n\nLet me just say one thing first: I love pork. There's nothing better than roasted pork tenderloin, perhaps wrapped in bacon with a honey, balsamic vinegar, and red wine sauce. I could eat pork breakfast, lunch, and dinner. \n\nI'm from California, so I'm not a typical Northwestern person. I like recycling, but composting is the absolute worst. I like saving the world and being green friendly, but I'm also cheap and hate buying more expensive green products. \n\nI love to travel and experience new things. I'm always looking for an inexpensive getaway for a week or weekend. (We may have that in common?) I'm also an introvert, which makes me kind of a contradiction since I'm also really loud and possibly obnoxious. \n\nMy life motto: Don't be an a-hole. And that is the truth. And be extra nice to people in service jobs, k thanks.\n\nPeople tell me I'm funny. It's true. I am funny. Someone told me I'm captivating the other day. That just makes me roll my eyes though.\n\nI am a fanboy for Jurassic Park. It's my favorite movie, and I will not tolerate anyone disliking it! You can dislike numbers 2-4 though. I won't fault you that. Maybe just don't bring it up. ;)\n\nI'm also a ridiculous fan of Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire. Maybe you'll see my tattoo from the novels. MAYBE NOT.\n\nMy favorite all time place to travel is South Lake Tahoe. I grew up going there every year, and it just doesn't get any better than that. There is something particularly magnificent about its smell. Pine trees are my favorite. You might notice that in my tree-themed library/entryway. I love trees.\n\nPlaces I've traveled to: Caribbean, France, Spain, Italy, Monaco, Israel, England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii, Grand Canyon, Chicago, Boston, Vancouver, BC, Portland, OR, Ukraine, Austria, Hungary, Thailand, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and New Zealand. My next trips are Iceland and South Africa! I'm visiting a past airbnb guest. I CAN'T WAIT!\n\nPlaces I've lived: Sacramento area, CA, Salt Lake City, UT, and Seattle, WA.\n\nI don't have five things I can't live without. I have one. And that is my smart phone. I will die before I give it up. It is always within a foot of me, and I feel lost without it.\n\nAs a host, I hope I'm welcoming and provide a few laughs and fantastic food recommendations. Or we might not even meet. It all depends on the day! My full-time job is unpredictable. My house may not be the place for you if you depend on having a host there all the time to make you breakfast, entertain you, or turn your bed down at night.
